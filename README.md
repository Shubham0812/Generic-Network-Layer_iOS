# Generic-Network-Layer_iOS 

Generic Network Layer created using URLSession.

Networking is an essential element in app development, and you'll need API calls in almost every app.

Creating Network Layers is challenging. Most of the time, it grows so large that it becomes tough to debug or reuse. And you, like me, end up writing the Network Layer for a different app from scratch.


To avoid this, I'll show you how to create a Generic Network Layer that is scalable, and you can easily reuse it in the future with Application/API-specific changes.

We'll write Models for the APIs, enums for NetworkErrors, HTTPMethods, and code our APIRequestManager with Generic GET and POST functions.
